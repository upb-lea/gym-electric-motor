    "## 1.    Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The gym-electric-motor (GEM) package is a Python toolbox for the simulation and control of various electric motors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is built upon [OpenAI Gym Environments](https://gym.openai.com/), and, therefore, can be used for both, classical control simulation and reinforcement learning experiments. It allows you to construct a typical drive train with the usual building blocks, i.e. supply voltages, converters, electric motors and load models, and obtain not only a closed-loop simulation of this physical structure, but also a rich interface for plugging in any decision making algorithm, from PI-controllers to [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/ddpg.html) agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1  Installation\n",
    "Before you can start, you need to make sure that you have gym-electric-motor installed. You can install it easily using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install gym-electric-motor\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "Alternatively, install the latest developer version directly from GitHub:\n",
    "https://github.com/upb-lea/gym-electric-motor\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we can install it by executing the following cell."

    "### 1.2 Building Blocks\n",
    "A GEM environment consists of following building blocks:\n",
    "- Physical Structure:\n",
    "   - Supply Voltage\n",
    "   - Converter\n",
    "   - Electric motor\n",
    "   - Load Model\n",
    "- Utility functions for reference generation, reward calculation and visualization\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Information Flow in a GEM Environment\n",
    "![](../../docs/plots/SCML_Overview.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following motor models are included:\n",
    "\n",
    "Four DC motors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- permanently excited motor\n",
    "- externally excited motor\n",
    "- series motor\n",
    "- shunt motor\n",
    "\n",
    "Two three phase motors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- PMSM (permanent magnet synchronous motor)\n",
    "- SynRM (synchronous reluctance motor)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two variants of the induction motor:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SCIM (squirrel cage induction motor)\n",
    "- DFIM (doubly fed induction motor)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following converters are included:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 quadrant converter (1QC)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2 quadrant converter (2QC) as an asymmetric half bridge with both current polarities\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4 quadrant converter (4QC)\n",
    "\n",
    "- B6 Bridge Converter (B6C)\n",
    "\n",
    "All converters can consider interlocking times and a dead time of one sampling interval.\n",
    "Furthermore, they can be controlled with a discrete action space or a continuous action space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete actions are the direct switching states of the transistors.\n",
    "Continuous actions are the duty cycles for a pulse width modulation on the transistors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The load model consists of a quadratic load function, with user defined coefficients. \n",
    "Furthermore the moment of inertia of the load attached to the motor can be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The included states for each motor are summarized and briefly described in the [Motor Dashboard](visualizations/motor_dashboard.html).\n",
    "Every state that can be plotted can also be used in the state filter or as observed state.\n",
    "The actions are basically understood as the desired duty cycles. The actual applied voltage can be taken from the observations.\n",
    "The observations are normalized to their physical limits that can be accessed with `env.limits`.\n",
    "Therefore, all values are typically in a range of [0, 1] or [-1, 1] without limit violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "All nominal values of voltages and currents are DC values in the case of a DC motor and peak phase values for the PMSM.\n",
    "Therefore, data sheet values for line voltage and phase currents of a PMSM has to be transformed with:\n",
    "$U_N = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}U_L$, $I_N = \\sqrt{2}I_S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the angular velocity is the mechanical one and not the electrical:\n",
    "$p\\omega_me = p\\omega = \\omega_el$\n",

    "    This function performs one action on the environment for one time step.\n",
    "    It simulates the motor and needs to be called in every time step.\n",
    "    First, the voltage applied on the motor due to the converter output is determined and then an ODE solver is used to compute the next state. \n",
    "    Eventually, the reward is evaluated and returned together with the next observation and a flag indicating termination.\n",
    "    Several reward functions are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `env.render()`    \n",
    "    Update the visualization of the motor states.\n",
